# Mastering_Chess
Chess project from College course. 

## Summary
A java application that implements the game of Chess. Created as a Data Structures assignment for college.

## Updates
If i can recall, the program is 90% functional. There are two gasme state conditions that do not currently work as they should. I`ll need to look at this project once more to figure out its errors. Keep this project open for examination.

## Instructions
The program was run through an IDE. (I believe i used Eclipse for this program)
