# Mastering_Chess

## Summary
A java application that simulates the game of Chess. Created as a Data Structures assignment for college.

## Instructions
The program was run through an IDE of your choice. Eclipse was the IDE used during the creation of this assignment.

## Updates
If I can recall, the program is 90% functional. There are two game state conditions that do not currently work as they should. Will require further analysis before submission.
